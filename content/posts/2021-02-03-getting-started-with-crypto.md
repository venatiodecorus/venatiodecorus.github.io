I decided to dig into the world of smart contracts and blockchains and see what is possible with them.

## Tools

Had some issues getting [Remix Desktop](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-desktop/releases) running. Might not be the best option, at least until it gets fixed. I was able to get Remix running by downloading the source and building from the [Remix Project](https://github.com/ethereum/remix-project) repository. This will run in your browser locally, not a desktop app.

There are some VSCode plugins for Ethereum/Solidity as well. I decided to start with Remix since it seemed like a pretty good solution out of the box and a good starting point.

Remix seems to run a development chain itself as I can deploy right from within it, the Javascript VM. It also lets you set a Web3 provider.

For local dev tools, there seem to be two major options, [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache) and [Geth](https://geth.ethereum.org).

## Setting up local dev

Remix seems to be ready to go. I'm trying to install Ganache.
